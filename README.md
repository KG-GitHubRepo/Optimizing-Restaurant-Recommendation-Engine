# Optimizing-Restaurant-Recommendation-Engine
Restaurant reservation company has introduced a recommendation engine on its platform to suggest restaurants to users. The company wishes to evaluate the effectiveness of these recommendations and optimize them for better user engagement.


### Columns Explanation:

- `User_ID`: Unique identifier for each user.
- `Age_Group`: Age category the user falls into.
- `Preferred_Cuisine`: The type of cuisine the user prefers based on past reservations and searches.
- `Last_Visited_Restaurant`: The most recent restaurant the user visited.
- `Recommendation_Clicked`: Indicates if the user clicked on the restaurant recommendation provided by EazyDiner (`Yes` or `No`).
- `Reservation_Made`: Indicates if the user made a reservation after clicking on the recommendation (`Yes` or `No`).
- `Visit_Rating`: Rating is given by the user for the restaurant they visited through the recommendation. 'NA' if no reservation was made.

### Tasks

1. Determine the overall success rate of the recommendation engine in terms of user clicks and reservations made.
2. Analyze the effectiveness of recommendations based on the `Age_Group` and `Preferred_Cuisine`. Identify any patterns or segments where recommendations are particularly successful or lacking.
3. Based on the `Visit_Rating`, evaluate the satisfaction of users with the recommended restaurants.
4. Analyze the data to deduce if the name or type of the `Last_Visited_Restaurant` has any impact on users trusting the next recommendation. For instance, do users who last visited a seafood restaurant trust a seafood recommendation more?
5. Provide suggestions on how EazyDiner can improve its recommendation algorithm to better cater to user preferences and improve reservation rates.
